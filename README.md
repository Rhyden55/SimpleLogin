# SimpleLogin
Simple automated login scripts in python for major sites.
Most scripts are self explanatory.
Please edit your personal login information in the appointed areas in the scripts.
These scripts depend on undetectable-chromedriver in order to call websites. Please install using requirements.txt or install using pip install undetectable-chromedriver.
These scripts also come with batch files for windows users.
Keep in mind Redbubble will always ask for captcha solves.
